1.0 - BRACE CONVENTION

Braces always occupy a new line exactly below the opening statement.
Braces are not expected when the body is a single statement.
If one part of an if-else construct uses braces then all should,
even if they're single statements.

Example:
0:
	if (condition)
	{
		// body
	}
	else
	{
		// else-body
	}

1:
	unsigned max(unsigned x, unsigned y)
	{
		if (x > y) return x;
		return y;
	}

2:
	unsigned array[] =
	{
		0, 1,
		2, 3,
	};

This follows for every use of a brace.

Exceptions:
0:
	static inline max(unsigned x, unsigned y)
		{ return (x > y ? x : y); }

1:
	unsigned array[] = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };



2.0 - BRACKET SPACING

All control keywords should have a space between the keyword and the opening bracket.
Function calls and definitions will never have a space between the name and bracket.

Example:
0: if (condition)
1: x = min(a, b);

Counter-example:
0: if(condition)
1: x = min (a, b);



3.0 - OPERATOR SPACING

Binary operators always have a single space either side.
Unary operators never have a space between them and their value.
Assignments are treated as binary operators.

Example:
0: a = b + 5;
1: a++;

Counter-example:
0: a=b+5;
1: a ++;



4.0 - OPERATOR PRECIDENCE

Where operators with different precidence are used together you must always
use brackets to make the precidence explicit.
Never rely on the compilers precidence rules as readers will forget this.

Example:
0: y = (m * x) + a;
1: if ((a || b) && c)

Counter-example:
0: y = m * x + a;
1: if (a || b && c)



5.0 - INDENTATION AND WHITESPACE

Tabs must ALWAYS be used for nesting/indentation.
Spaces must ALWAYS be used for alignment.

Example:
0:
	if (condition)
		return value;
1:
	int      mins(int      x, int      y);
	unsigned minu(unsigned x, unsigned y);



6.0 - ADVANCED CONTROL FLOW

If the body of an if statement causes the function to return
or control structure to break then there musn't be an else clause.

Example:
0:
	if (condition)
		return a;
	return b;

Counter-example:
0:
	if (condition)
		return a;
	else
		return b;



7.0 - LINE WIDTH

A line must not exceed 80 characters wide, this applies universally including
comments defines, etc.

There are multiple valid points to break a line.
	- On a binary operator, in which case the binary operator follows on the
		next line with an indent.
	- On a function definition/implementation the parameters may go on another
		line, in which case they are indented. In this case the params should
		be split sensibly and are aligned by the fact that they're all
		indented to the same point.

Examples:
0:
	some_really_long_variable_name
		= quite_a_long_value;
1:
	if (really_really_really_long_clause_a
		&& (really_really_really_long_clause_b
			|| really_really_really_long_clause_c)
		&& really_really_really_long_clause_d
		&& really_really_really_long_clause_e)
2:
	static inline const unsigned long int really_long_function(
		unsigned param_a,
		int      param_b,
		bool     param_c);



8.0 - COMMENTS

All comments must use the classic C comment styles and preceed what they're
commenting on.
All comments must be in plain english starting with a capital letter
and finishing with a full stop.

Example:
0:
	/* Single line comment about a. */
	a = 0;
1:
	/* Multi-line comment
	 * about the code below. */
	a = 0;



9.0 - LABELS AND GOTO

It is advised quite heavily that you don't use the GOTO keyword and prefer other
more readable control structures.



10.0 - STRUCTURES, UNIONS, ENUMS, BITFIELDS and TYPEDEFS

Suffixes must be used for the various types:
	_s - struct names
	_u - union names
	_t - typedef'd struct/union names
	_e - enums (and typedef'd enums) "_e"
Enums must always be typedef'd.
Enum values must be prefixed by the enum name.
Structs which rely on ordering must use __attribute__((__packed__)).

Bitfields:
	- must always use __attribute__((__packed__)).
	- must always follow the GCC rules regarding bitfields.
		i.e. first field occupies low bits.
	- field size must be described for every member of a bit-field.
	- members must never be larger than 32 bits.

Examples:
0:
	typedef enum
	{
		fuzzy_no = 0,
		fuzzy_yes,
		fuzzy_maybe,
	} fuzzy_e;
1:
	struct vector_s
		{ float x, y, z, w; };
	typedef struct vector_s vector_t;
2:
	union types_u
	{
		int      i;
		unsigned u;
		float    f;
		bool     b;
	};
	typedef union types_u types_t;
3:
	typedef struct
	{
		bool     vflip    : 1;
		bool     hflip    : 1;
		unsigned reserved : 2;
		unsigned alpha    : 4;
	} img_desc_t;
